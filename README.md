The objective of 2048 is to achieve “2048” on one of your tiles. To achieve “2048”, you must make matches on the board. To make a match, you must slide two tiles that have the same number on them together. So if you have two “2” tiles next to one another and you slide them so that they would be next to each other at the end of that move, the two tiles will combine. The two tiles will combine to make one tile with the number “4” in it. This new “4” tile will only be able to match with another tile with the number “4” in it.

At the start of the game, there are two tiles on your board. The two tiles will have a low number on them, most likely a “2” or a “4”. The board has the potential to hold 16 tiles. To play, you have to slide the screen either vertically or horizontally. If you slide horizontally, all of the tiles will move as far as they can to the horizontal wall. If you slide vertically, all of the tiles will move as far as they can to the vertical wall. A tile can only go as far as there are open spaces for it to slide into.

Every time you slide the tiles to one side of the board, or the wall, it counts as a move. With each move you make in 2048, a new tile is added to the board. The new tile will be a low number. So, hypothetically, if you make a lot of moves without making any matches, the board will continue to fill up until you have no empty spaces for you tiles to move into. Once this happens, and you cannot make any matches, you lose the game. That is basically all you need to know for how to play 2048.
2048 is a puzzle game that is fueled by simple addition. These are the addition problems you should know that are the core of how to play the game:
2 + 2 = 4
4 + 4 = 8
8 + 8 = 16
16 + 16 = 32
32 + 32 = 64
64 + 64 = 128
128 + 128 = 256
256 + 256 = 512
512 + 512 = 1,024
1,024 + 1,024 = 2,048
And it’s not a game changer if you don’t know math. When it comes down to it, 2048 is a matching game. You just want to slide the tiles will the same number into each other. Be careful: when you get higher numbered tiles, they’ll get in your way of matching other tiles and your board can easily become congested. Good Luck and have fun!
